# Topics I Have Learned
**I have discovered how to create a list in GitHub by using by using a hyphen or an asterisks**

  A common mistake I made when styling text was using spaces when applying Asterisks to create italic text, which can cause an error. If spacing out the asterisks when you run your text, the computer will generate what you've written.
  
  For example:
  ~* Cookies for sell *~ to *Cookies for sell* makes a major difference.
